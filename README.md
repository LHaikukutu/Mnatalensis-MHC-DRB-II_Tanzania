# Mnatalensis-MHC-DRB-II_Tanzania
Here we deposit the data for the MHC class ii DRB of wild-captured Mastomys natalensis individuals sampled from plague endemic and non-endemic zones in Tanzania.
An Excel file (Masto_MHCII-DRB2_sequences_Haikukutuetal2023) listing all 111 mhc ii DRB alleles sequences of M. natalensisis provided together with the data file containing all individual information of 305 M. natalensis genotyped in this study.
A. Sample ID (unique field identifier) B. Site (sampling location/district in Tanzania) C. Site-status(Plague_endemic or non-endemic) D. Village (name of the village) E.Village endemicity status(plague endemic or non-endemic) F. weight (Body mass) G. (Sex (Male or Female) H. Sex condition(reproductive status) I. Flea_No (number of fleas infesting on each M.natalensis individual) J. Flea_species (Flea taxonomic identity) K. Pestis_infection (negative or positive) L. i_elisa (binary presence or absence of anti-F1 antibodies) M. c_elisa (binary presence or absence of specific anti_F1 antibodies) N. sample ID (unique lab identifier) O-DV. (MHC ii DRB allele binary presence or absence of each of the 111 alleles) DW-EB.(Binary presence or absence of each of the 6 flea genera) EC-EK.(Binary presence or absence of each of the supertypes) EL. ST_Nr (number of supertypes present)
